# Fake News Classifier

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a machine learning project that classifies news articles as either fake or true using natural language processing techniques.

## Project Overview

The Fake News Classifier is a machine learning project developed to combat misinformation by accurately identifying fake news articles. The project utilizes the NLTK library for data preprocessing and scikit-learn for training the classifier. The trained model, based on Logistic Regression, achieves an impressive accuracy of 98%.

## Notebook

The main component of this project is the Jupyter Notebook `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb`. This notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains labeled news articles for training and evaluation.

## Usage

To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install it via Anaconda or using pip. Once installed, simply open the `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through the process.
